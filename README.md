# Icarus Sever Manager
### Current Version: Alpha 1.0

## Using Icarus Server Manager
### Installing
When you first download the Icarus Server Manager you will need to point it at an existing Icarus server installation. If you do not have an existing installation you can go to the Manager Settings tab and select a directory to install the server into. Once the directory is selected you will see a message on the console instructing you if an installation was found. At this point you can click the "Install Server" button to either install the server or perform an update and verify on existing server files.

### Basic Settings
The three most important settings to input are under the "Server Settings". These three settings are "Server Name", "Query Port", and "Game Port". The default ports are already entered and don't need to be changed unless it's necessary for your environment.

It is also important that you set the "Restart Interval" on the "Manager Settings" tab to meet your requirements *(Defaults to 1 hour)*

## Upcoming Updates
- Make manager read and manage the server ini files
- Visual enhancement to introduce "Dark Mode"
- Make auto-restart system more adjustable
